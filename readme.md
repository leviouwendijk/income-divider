# Use

Just pass whatever your paycheck is:

```zsh
income 1500
```

And it will calculate savings allocations.

Either absolutely (using full principal amount of income specified) or relatively (of whatever is the remainder -- relies on order of priority for accounts).

This is default:

10% (absolute) -> savings
20% (relative) -> income_tax
10% (relative) -> charges
